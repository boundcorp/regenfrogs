# Auto-unlocking is suffering some difficulties when switching between branches
# Disabled for now - you can still use the "clean" filter to auto-lock any unlocked files
# and unlock them by hand with `scripts/sops/sops-unlock -i <file>`
# Note: use `cat` to define a smudge filter that does nothing, or else it will fail on branch change
